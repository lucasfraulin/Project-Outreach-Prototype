                  In Peru over half the population lives below the poverty line. The average income for many is less than $2 a day. 1/3 of homes cook on open fires, have no running water, or electricity. Burns are the most common injury in the
                  developing world. In Peru 100,000 per year suffer significant burns, that would require medical intervention. Peru health care covers the cost for initial management, however do not cover the costs for scar reconstruction, as this
                  is
                  deemed cosmetic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  October 2011, Project Outreach was invited to Peru, to work with Aniquem (www.aniquem.org) a local charity, to help care for children with devastating burn scars. We completed 116 operations, over 8 operating days, on 33 young
                  patients. We returned in October 2012 to Peru and completed 88 operations on 32 children. We were invited back in 2013, and 2015. Our 2015 mission was funded with generous support of Gran Tierra Energy and their Iquitos team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We work together with our local Peruvian colleagues, teaching students nurses, and physicians. Our colleagues and friends at Aniquem provide the ongoing burn rehabilitation to our patients after we leave.

                  ​Burn reconstructive surgery gives these children the chance to lead productive lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cost of a surgical mission, if performed in Canada is approxiamately $250,000.00.

                  Marco was one of many children we were able to help on our first mission to Peru.​ Project Outreach met Marco again in 2013 and was able to complete his last reconstructive surgery. Now he is becoming a young man, he has hopes, dreams, and self esteem to reach his goals.  He and his family thank you; the donors, that help Project Outreach help him and many others like him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Project Outreach continues to work with Aniquem.  The need for burn reconstructive surgery continues and is overwhelming. Through the generous donation of ScotiaBank Canada we will return to Peru in November 2019.

                  Project Outreach was invited to Ecuador in 2003. The unusually high incidence of children with hip dysplasia, clubfeet and other ailments that were left untreated because of unaffordable medical costs. Only 5% of the Ecuadorian
                  population can afford the cost of medical treatment, hospital care, or prescription drugs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  For impoverished families, life with a child that has a physical disability is extremely stressful, emotionally and economically. Without outside help, medical costs are too much and so treatment and medication is not an option.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-primary">Josef</h4>
                <p>
                  Project Outreach first met Josef when he was 5 yrs old. Josef suffers from a congenital bone disorder called Osteogenesis Imperfecta, also known as Brittle Bone Disease. We performed several operations to repair Josef's bones
                  fractured in the year previous.  The procedures were long and painful but necessary if Josef was to ever live a healthy, happy and productive life.  He was put on medication to supplement what own body was lacking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At age 13, Josef gave us a surprise, he showed us that not only could he stand with the support of the walker, he was able to walk without help from anyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beaming with pride, this young boy embraced the opportunity afforded by the donations given to Project Outreach, to conquer pain and defeat his disability.  He was able to attend school with his siblings, and graduated at the top of
                  his class.  Josef is smart and he has a winning personality. Now, he too will be able to make his way in his world, not as a burden, but with pride and confidence he would never have had without donations to Project Outreach.

                  Project Outreach has maintained an ongoing connection with out colleagues in Danang Vietnam over the years.  In 2017 Project Outreach was invited to return to Vietnam and work at the Tam Tri Danang General Hospital to provide care
                  to the indigenous people; Mountegards, who live remotely in the mountains of central Vietnam.  The majority of our young patients were malnourished, and anemic.  We worked closely with our local health care colleagues and the Smile
                  of Compassion Charity  We returned in May 2018.
